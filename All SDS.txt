All seven deadly sins

[001] toad

[003] sloth
I once imagine that we live somewhere that is far, far away from everything we know before.
Somewhere, like a village, that isolate from this mundane world.
Together with you I laze around, blabblering nonsense from yesterday and watching the sun sets over the horizon, while the wind breeze through our face.
I would skip all the work just to be there, just to be with you, just to spend time with you.
When I woke up, I will see your face everyday, my mind will go numb and continue sleeping beside you.
Tomorrow I will be with you the whole day, from the bed to the end, and the day after tomorrow, and the day after that, and another day after that
so on and so on.
Being with you, even when we do nothing, really soothen my heart.
I wish to be there with you at the end of everything.
One day
