# TBVN
personal project for the upcoming 7th anniversary
## Description
TBVN (is supposed to be Text-Based Visual Novel but it has a weak point of visual so just call it-), A text-based minigame that made in batch language, this is to make things easier to run without any additional installation (if you use Window, that is).
## Instruction
Download the file from "release" tab at the right then extract and run `84.bat`

Password for the file is the barcode identification number of the seal

*Window will stop you from starting it since it is a language that is near a machine language, which make the machine vulnerable than a user-friendly language like _python_ or _ruby_.

## Hint and tips
* There are easter eggs hidden in the script.
* All the first layer code can be found under this (most are in all lowercase)
    * a chamber (such as a vault) wholly or partly underground with "os" after it

    * name of the first group of humans without any symbol or space within it

    * the abbreviated by the sound of the name of a famous Roman general and statemen

    * a continuation of lives through the descendants after death

    * a name of a fruit that is green, smooth, with a large seed, with "s" after it

    * A triple female sex chromosome

    * an anonymous English-language imageboard website, some describe it as a peachy hell

There is no obligation to solve this from top to bottom, you can start at any challenge you would like to.

## Progress
This project started since 22 January and the first final version is released in 26 January

It is expected to be open at the midnight of 28 January

It can be considered an upgraded version of the last year version as it's more focused on playability than a series of text smashed into it, though, one might say that it is unnecessary to make it this complex just for a year celebration and should be more focused on something that is concrete instead.
